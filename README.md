# C482Project

Project for C482 - Software 1 at Western Governors University. 
Scenario:
"You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program."

Students create a Java FX project using NetBeans or IntelliJ JDEA, as well as Scene Builder, to create an Inventory Management System IAW with the given rubric. 

This project is still in the works.
